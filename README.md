# workday-scheduler
This is a work day schedular given to us with a starter code. I worked on the javascript using jquery, I created current date and dynamic time. I also created time blocks with text areas, to add to do items for the work day. I also created a local storage to save the items by clicking a button.

## Getting Started

* create a repo
* write pseudocode 
* added time bloxks to HTML 
* added js using jquery

### Steps
// moment. format to display the current day text at the header
// moment. format to display current time
// call upon the current time and set interval to make it dynamic
// calling upon elements
// function to present, past and future color coded 
// need to call upon current time to compare
// loop for time blocks
// when clicked on the save btn
// the text in the text area is saved in the storage
// need to get item and stay after refreshing
// lets call the functions
